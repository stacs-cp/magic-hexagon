- `run.sh` runs the entire experiment
- `*.essence` files contain the models
- `conjure-output` contains the info files, the solution files (where they exist) and plots (again, where they exist)
- `native-experiment` is a native version of the model written in Python and C++. This is used to investigate the effect of linear relaxation in OR-Tools
